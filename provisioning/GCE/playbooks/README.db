In order to run the delete_instance.yml playbook we should call it like this:
ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT=2201 ansible-playbook -vvvv -e "env=staging" delete_instance.yml

^ that is because during provisioning, we change the ssh port to 2201.



To run the create_instance.yml playbook:
ansible-playbook -vvvv -e "env=staging" create_instance.yml

^ the instance names are hardcoded into the playbook, can be placed in a variable.



The parameter -e  "env=staging" is passed as an ansible extra variable. This is not fully 
functional atm, but it serves as a PoC for managing variables for dynamic environments, 
AKA staging and production.


If some VM/s fails, then Ansible will create a *retry file with the inventory for the failed VMs.
So in order to re-run these, we'd just type:
ansible-playbook -vvvv -e "env=staging" -i *retry.yml


After we create the instances, in order to run some module or playbook on the existing VMs, we'd run 
Ansible with the dynamic inventory:
ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT=2201 ansible all -i inventory/ -m ${MODULE}
ANSIBLE_REMOTE_PORT=2201 ansible-playbook -vvvv ${PLAYBOOK} -i inventory/
